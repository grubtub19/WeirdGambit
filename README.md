# WeirdGambit's Wizard of Oz 

# Description:

  This is a utility to supplement paired programming. In paired programming, you switch between writing and observing the writer. This program has two modes: Programmer and Oz. The Programmer recieves advice from the "Oz" who is portrayed as an avatar and communicates through text and text-to-speech. This program is for research purposes and is a fully-functional prototype for our Senior Software class.

# Instructions:

  Import into a c# development environment (like Visual Studio) and run WpfApp1/WpfApp3/Launcher. In this window, as the Oz, type "Oz network" to start the server. As the Programmer, type the IP address of the Oz and choose your input devices (Oz must be entered first). You will be presented with an interface. 
  Included is a text chat, avatar controller, text-to-speech button, and Programmer to Oz webcam feed. When you press the "Speak" button and say something into the microphone, the programmer will hear it as text-to-speech. To get the webcam stream working, press "Enable Webcam" and "Enable Stream" on the Programmer and Oz respectively. Pressing the emoji buttons as the Oz will change the facial expression of the avatar the Programmer sees. The text chat works as you would expect a text chat to work.
